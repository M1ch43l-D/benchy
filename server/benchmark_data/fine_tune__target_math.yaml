benchmark_name: "Fine Tuning: Target Math"
purpose: "Evaluate the model's ability to create an arithmetic equation that reaches a given target-number using provided numbers."
base_prompt: |
  <purpose>
      Create an equation that equals the target-number given the numbers-provided.
  </purpose>

  <instructions>
      <instruction>You can only use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)</instruction>
      <instruction>Do not use = in your equation. Simply output the equation we can paste directly into a calculator.</instruction>
      <instruction>Each number can only be used once</instruction>
      <instruction>Don't use latex or any fancy formatting. Use basic arithmetic operations.</instruction>
      <instruction>Output your equation without any other text</instruction>
  </instructions>
