                        "response": "---\nOkay, so I need to create an equation using the numbers 95, 11, and 56 that equals 28. All right, let's think about how to approach this. The allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each number can be used only once. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try combining the numbers in different ways. Let me list all possible permutations of the three numbers. There are 3! = 6 permutations, so that's manageable.\n\nThe numbers are 95, 11, and 56. Let's consider different operations:\n\n1. Maybe subtract one number from another and then multiply or divide by the third. For example, 95 - 11 = 84. Then 84 * 56 would be way too big. 84 /56 is 1.5. Not helpful. If I subtract 56 from 95: 95-56=39. Then multiply or divide by 11. 39*11=429, which is too big. 39/11≈3.545… Not 28.\n\n2. How about addition and division. Let's see: 11 +56 =67. Then 67 divided by something doesn't help. 11 could be subtracted from 56: 56-11=45. Then 95-45=50. Not 28. Maybe 95 divided by … Let's think, 95 divided by something. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps 95 and 56 are both larger than 28, so maybe subtract them from each other and then combine with 11. For instance, 56 - 11 = 45, then 95 -45 =50. Not 28. 95 -56=39. 39 minus 11 is 28! Wait, wait, 95 -56 is 39, then minus 11 gives 28. So the equation would be 95 - 56 - 11 =28. But wait, that's using subtraction twice, but each number is used once: 95,56,11 are all used once in order. Let me check the math:\n\n95 -56 is 39. 39 -11 is indeed 28. So that seems to work. \n\nBut wait, how about the order? The equation could be written as 95 - 56 -11 =28, using each number once. So maybe that's the solution. Let me confirm.\n\nYes: 95 minus 56 is 39, then subtract 11 gives 28. So that's valid. But let me check if there's another possible combination, perhaps with multiplication or division. Could that be? \n\nFor instance, 56 divided by something. If I take 56 divided by (something), maybe... 56/ (95/11). Let's compute that. 95 divided by11 is approx 8.636. Then 56 divided by 8.636 ≈ 6.48… Not 28.\n\nAlternatively, 11*(something) equals 28. If I take 11*(28/11)=28, but that would require 28/11, which isn't in our numbers. Maybe using subtraction within division: Let's see. (95 -11) =84. 84 divided by 56 is 1.5. Still no. \n\nAlternatively, (95 - (56 +11)) =95 -67=28. Oh, wait! That's another way. 95 minus (56+11)=28. So the equation could be 95 - (56 +11) =28. But according to the instructions, parentheses are allowed, as long as we use basic operations. \n\nBut both equations are the same in terms of arithmetic. The second is grouping the addition first, but the result is the same as 95 -56 -11. However, since the original numbers were 95,11,56, how does that play in? Let me check if the order matters in how the equation is written. Since parentheses can be used, but we can also structure without if possible. \n\nWait, the target equation needs to use each number once, but the operations can be between any. So in both cases, all three numbers are used once, and each operation is between two numbers. In the equation 95 -56 -11, we're subtracting two numbers, which is allowed. Similarly, 95 - (56 +11) uses all three numbers once. \n\nBut maybe the user expects a multiplicative step. Wait, but let me re-examine the example given. In the problem statement, maybe there's a simpler way. Let me double-check:\n\nIf I subtract 56 and 11 from 95, that's 95-56-11=28. Alternatively, 95 - (56 +11) =28. Both of these equations are valid. If the user allows subtraction of two numbers and then subtraction again, then it would work. \n\nBut according to the instructions, each number can only be used once, and each operation is between two numbers. To get to 28, this approach might be the correct one. I need to verify if exponents are allowed, but no, the problem states only basic operations. Parentheses are allowed as they are part of structuring the equation.\n\nAlternatively, using division or multiplication, but none come to mind. Let me check other possibilities for confirmation. \n\nTrying multiplication: 11 * something: 11 * 2.545≈28, but not using the numbers. What about 56/2: 28, but that's 56/2=28, but 2 isn't provided. Alternatively, 56 * (something) =28, but 0.5 isn't among the numbers. \n\nWait, 56 divided by 11 is approximately 5.09. Then 95 minus 5.09 is about 89.9. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: 95 minus (56 divided by 11). That would be 95 - 5.09≈89.9, which is not 28. Nope.\n\nWait, what if (95 -11)/(something) equals 28? (95-11) =84. Then 84 divided by 3 =28. But 3 isn't present. So 84 divided by (56/ something). 84/(56/x) would require x, but that's complicating things and perhaps involves fractions, which may not lead us anywhere. \n\nAlternatively, 95 / (11 + something). 95 divided by a number to get 28. Let's see, 28 * (11 + x) =95. But that's (95 /28) ≈3.3928. Then 3.3928 -11 = negative, which isn't useful here.\n\nAnother angle: 11 times something minus another number. 11*5 =55, 55 - 56- something? Doesn't lead to 28. \n\nWait, thinking back. The straightforward way seems to be 95-56-11=28. Let's check the calculation step by step.\n\n95 minus 56: 95-56 is 39. \n\n39 minus 11: 39-11 equals 28. \n\nYes, so three numbers used: 95,56,11. Each used once. Only subtraction. According to the instructions, that's allowed because we can do consecutive subtractions. So the equation would be 95-56-11=28. \n\nAlternatively, if adding parentheses: 95 - (56 +11)=95-67=28. Either form is correct. The problem states to output the equation directly. Without using =, Just the equation. So perhaps either is acceptable, but the simplest form would be 95 - 56 -11 =28.\n\nTherefore, this equation meets the requirements: uses all numbers once, uses basic operations (subtraction twice in this case), and equals 28.\n\nLet me verify one more time:\n\n95 -56 =39\n\n39 -11 =28. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the equation is correctly formed.\n</think>\n\n95-56-11",
